# Python-Sequence-pair-matching.-Dot-algorithm

The written program is a visual comparison of the coding sequence of proteins, as well as DNA. The program allows you to load the sequence in two ways: manually or from a FASTA file, it generates a dot plot as a form of a 2-dimensional table. In addition, the program allows you to filter the dot matrix for a given window size and filter threshold. The filtered dot matrix is ​​displayed graphically.
